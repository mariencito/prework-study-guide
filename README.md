- Ive always wanted to do this since I was small. I always thought it super cool, and now that im actually getting started and getting into it, I found out that it was actually amazing. I want to learn as much as I can and I want to do this for a career.
- I wanted to create a website that would hold my notes, I also wanted to build a website in general
- It helps me get a better understanding of creating a website and it also allows me to write notes for myself to look at for the future
- I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned GitFlow. I messed up with the first branch but once I got it down it was pretty smooth and easy.

## Usage

I can use it to look at my notes. Each section has info about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. Whenever I forget a command I can look at my notes and see what i am missing. This website is running JavaScript even though its not clear to the naked eye. Once you open up the console you should see JavaScript going to work.
